    Parameters
    ----------

    sequence
      The sequence of interest. ATGC string.

    enzymes_names
      List of names of the enzymes to plot.

    forbidden_enzymes
      The sites of these enzymes will also be plotted, but with a red
      background.

    unique_sites
      If true, for each enzyme in enzyme_name with more than one site in
      the sequence, these will be plotted on a red background.

    ax
      Matplotlib ax on which to draw the figure. If none is provided a new
      figure is created and the ax is returned at the end.

    figure_width
      Width of the figure if no ax is provided and a new figure is returned.

    annotate_inline
      If True, the enzyme names will be written inside the annotations
      when possible, instead of above.
