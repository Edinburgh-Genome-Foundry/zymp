Zymp
====

Zymp is a Python library to design "restriction site arrays", which are
compact sequences with many restriction sites.

For instance here is a 159-nucleotide sequence made with Zymp, with 49 enzyme
recognition sites (out of 52 provided). That's a frequency of around
3 nucleotides per site:
